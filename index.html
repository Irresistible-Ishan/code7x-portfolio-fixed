I move through ideas the way light moves through a room — touching things, changing them slightly, never staying still. I build to understand, and I understand by breaking what I build. Some days that means code, some days shapes, symbols, systems, or questions that don’t resolve quickly. I’m not trying to arrive anywhere fast; I’m interested in what reveals itself when I stay with an idea long enough. Whatever I make is just a trace of that process — imperfect, evolving, honest.

  <p class="mainpagetext">
    My name is Ishan Mani Singh. I also go by CODE7X, a name that grew out of curiosity rather than intention — a marker for experiments, systems, and unfinished ideas. Both point to the same thing: a person still learning, still observing, still shaping thought into form, one piece at a time.
